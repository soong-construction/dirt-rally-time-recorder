## Goal
This tool allows you to track your stage times in DiRT Rally and DiRT Rally 2.0 and browse them, which the game itself does not allow.  

Time tracking works for stage rallies and the Pikes Peak events of the original DiRT Rally.  

> To check if the latest DiRT Rally 2.0 DLC is supported, look for or create an [issue.](https://github.com/soong-construction/dirt-rally-time-recorder/issues?q=label%3ADLC) 

## First time set up

You can choose to download *dirt-rally-time-recorder* as a ready-to-use bundle (tested to work on Windows 10 x64). If you don't trust pre-built .exe files, you can set it up from scratch. 

### Ready-to-use bundle
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/soong-construction/dirt-rally-time-recorder/releases/latest) for either the original DiRT Rally or 2.0 and unzip it somewhere
- Start ``timerecord.exe``
  - It should tell you to be *Waiting for data...*, otherwise take a look at [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)  

### ... or set up from scratch  
*These steps refer to Windows, Linux users will know how to use their package manager appropriately*

- Clone this repo or download and unpack its zip file to your disk
  - this creates your work folder, e.g. ``C:\dirtrally-time-recorder-master``
- Install Python 3.7: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download
  - If Python was installed already, ensure [pip is set up properly](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line) 
- Install dependencies
  - in a command prompt, run ``pip install PyYAML==5.3``
- Install SQLite: https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html  
  - choose the ``sqlite-tools-win32-x86-XXXXXX.zip`` package
  - extract ``sqlite3.exe`` to your work folder, i.e. next to ``timerecord.py``    
- Setup database with car and track tables by running `sqlite3.exe`  
  - ``.open --new dirtrally-lb.db`` 
  - ``.read setup-dr1.sql`` (or ``setup-dr2.sql``)
- Start time tracking  
  - open a command prompt (e.g. via the work folder context menu, this saves you from moving to this directory manually) and run ``python timerecord.py``
  - It should tell you to be *Waiting for data...*, otherwise check the set up or take a look at [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

### Configuration
If you prefer imperial units (mph), you can change the `speed_unit` in `config.yml` (default: kmh). Afterwards, restart *dirt-rally-time-recorder*. If you change this later on, you will falsify top speeds of recorded stages (unless you migrate your database)  

Before starting DiRT Rally [2.0] you need to enable UDP telemetry like so:
- Navigate to the settings directory of [DiRT Rally](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/DiRT_Rally#Configuration_file.28s.29_location) or [DiRT Rally 2.0](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/DiRT_Rally_2.0#Configuration_file.28s.29_location) (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\DiRT Rally 2.0\hardwaresettings\`)
- Open `hardware_settings_config.xml` with a text editor
- Enable telemetry and request extradata by adapting the appropriate line as follows: ``<udp enabled="true" extradata="3" ...``  
- Note for VR users: For the VR mode, the above setting has to be adapted in  `hardware_settings_config_vr.xml` as well
  
## Record stage times
- Start DiRT Rally [2.0] and finish a stage  
  - *dirt-rally-time-recorder* runs in the background, reporting the car and the track it identifies from the telemetry  
  - for cars, it will display control interface information such as the transmission type (based on [this discussion](http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/7071/dirt-rally-handbrake-and-transmission-information)) 
  - it will look something like this:
```
TRACK: Sweet Lamb
CAR: Volkswagen Golf GTI 16V (94.2477798461914 - 785.398193359375)
dirtrally.user1553422018.309.200.started:1|c
Volkswagen Golf GTI 16V: H-PATTERN shifting, 5 speed, with manual CLUTCH, with HANDBRAKE
```
- On stage completion, it reports your top speed and time and saves it to the database 
  - to quickly list your recorded times with SQLite, run ``list-laptimes.bat``  
  - to dump the database into a CSV file consumable by your favorite spreadsheet editor, run ``export-laptimes.bat``  

## Limitations
Since DiRT Rally [2.0] telemetry data doesn't allow to clearly identify every available car and track, this tool will sometimes ask you to resolve this after completing a stage.  

In order to consolidate the database, the tool prepares scripts for you, e.g. `1573403766_ElRodeo_PoloGTIR5.bat`
- go the folder where you set up *dirt-rally-time-recorder*  
- run the script file that matches the car you drove (e.g. double-click it)  
- you will barely notice a window opening and closing, and that's it
- you can delete the script files afterwards, e.g. you might find also find a `1573403766_ElRodeo_SkodaFabiaR5.bat`  

## Troubleshooting
When you import the CSV file as a spreadsheet, make sure to select UTF-8 encoding.   

If you encounter an error message talking about sockets, understand that this tool cannot run in parallel, but only in a single instance at the same time.  

In case you modified the telemetry ip or port in *hardware_settings_config.xml*, adapt ``config.yml`` accordingly.

Unless you use the bundled version, have a look at ``migrate.sql`` to find instructions how to migrate your database for new releases.    
If you encounter errors at start-up, see if renaming the file `dirtrally-laptimes.db` helps (which will create a new database).    

In any case, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/soong-construction/dirt-rally-time-recorder/issues/new).
